# Arduino LM1881 Text Inserter Code
 
Code I'm using for a very basic text inserter based on an Arduino Uno and an LM1881 IC.<br />
Includes stripboard layout, along with a file for the DIY Layout Creator program http://diy-fever.com/software/diylc/<br />

Make sure to get the Enhanced TVout Library, available from Nootropic Design, linked below.<br />
The stripboard layout is probably very inefficient, but it worked for me at least.<br />

I used these sources for the original schematics and code:<br />
